This folder contains all you need to perform or reproduce various flavours of tests:
* an input file (i.e., [Mol1.sdf](Mol1.sdf)) and a script ([run_test.sh](run_test.sh)) to perform a single run of the catalyst evaluator machinery. This works as an example of usage.
* testing of the catalyst evaluation metric against experimental data. See [test_set_1](test_set_1) folder. This contains data used in the scientific publication.
* testing of the catalyst evaluation metric against literature data. See [test_set_2](test_set_2) folder. This contains data used in the scientific publication.
* unit testing of code. See under the [unit](unit) folder. This is meant to verify the functionality upon chages of the code under [../src](../src).
