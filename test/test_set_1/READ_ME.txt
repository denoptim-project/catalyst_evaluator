        This directory contains the results generated from submitting six different input structures 
        (made with manual perturbations to internal coordinates and random noises added to each cartesian coordinate) 
        of each catalysts belonging to "test set one" to automatic fitness scoring (AF).

	- To retrieve mean values, and standard deviations of descriptors and weights 
          type the following in the current directory: ./scripts/standardDeviation.sh

	- To retrieve metathesis barriers, DDE (barrier difference between metathesis and B-HE decomposition) 
          type the following in the current directory: ./scripts/getBarriers.sh
