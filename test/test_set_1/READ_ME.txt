   This directory contains the results derived from submitting the six catalysts of "test set one", using six different perturbed input structures per catalyst, to automatic fitness scoring (AF).

	- To retrieve mean values, and standard deviations of descriptors and weights use the following: ./scripts/standardDeviation.sh
	- To retrieve metathesis barriers, DDE (barrier difference between metathesis and B-HE decomposition) use the following: ./scripts/getBarriers.sh
